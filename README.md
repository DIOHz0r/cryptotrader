## Synopsis

This command client is for search cryptocurrencies advertisements different web pages like 
[Localbitcoins](https://www.localbicoins.com) and [localcryptos](https://www.localcryptos.com), 
it also allows you to search the best prices to sell your cryptos on [Uphold](https://www.uphold.com) for now. 

More services and options will be available coming soon.

## Installation

You will need only PHP 7.1 or above and composer to use this.

Clone or download the repo and run.

```composer install --no-dev``` 

## How to use

### Localbitcoins

Suppose that you want to list all ads on localbitcoin.com payed in Euros just execute the following command.

```php bin/console localbtc:sell:online EUR```

This will order all the ads from the lowes price to the highest 
price in ascending order, that means that the last listed ads are the highest prices found.

Now if you want to filter the results for the top 15 ads with a price of 100 EUR execute the previous command as follows.

```php bin/console localbtc:sell:online EUR -a 100 -t 15```

### Localcryptos

For localcryptos the command is almost the same but you have to add the country [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) 
code as the first argument.

```php bin/console lc:sell:online AU -a 100 -t 15```

This command lists ETH as the default coin, but you can use all the coins listed in that platform.
You only need to add the `--coin (-n)` option and the corresponding code.

```php bin/console lc:sell:online AU -a 100 -t 15 -o LTC```

## Selling from Uphold

If you want to sell your Uphold card balance the script will look on each trading platform and will print the results 
as previous commands, you need to set at least the country and the currency to obtain, for instance to find the top 20 
ads in Venezuela (VE) for obtain 10000 Bolivares Soberanos (VES) selling your BTC or ETH excluding the not compatible 
ads execute:

```php bin/console uphold:sell VE VES -a 10000 -t 20 -x```
